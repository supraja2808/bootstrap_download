          <p>Will you do the same for me? It's time to face the music I'm no longer your muse. Heard it's beautiful, be the judge and my girls gonna take a vote. I can feel a phoenix inside of me. Heaven is jealous of our love, angels are crying from up above. Yeah, you take me to utopia.</p>

          <p>Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall. Heaven is jealous of our love, angels are crying from up above. Can't replace you with a million rings. Boy, when you're with me I'll give you a taste. There’s no going back. Before you met me I was alright but things were kinda heavy. Heavy is the head that wears the crown.</p>

              <p>Greetings loved ones let's take a journey. Yes, we make angels cry, raining down on earth from up above. Give you something good to celebrate. I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath. I'm ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans. As I march alone to a different beat. Summer after high school when we first met. You're so hypnotizing, could you be the devil? Could you be an angel? It's time to bring out the big balloons. Thought that I was the exception. Bikinis, zucchinis, Martinis, no weenies.</p>

          <p>I’m gon’ put her in a coma. You give a hundred reasons why, and you say you're really gonna try. So I sat quietly, agreed politely. Suiting up for my crowning battle. And on my 18th Birthday we got matching tattoos. So très chic, yeah, she's a classic. I am ready for the road less traveled.</p>
          <p>I'm walking on air (tonight). But down to earth. You're original, cannot be replaced. But in another life I would be your girl. We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach. We can dance, until we die, you and I, will be young forever. Saw you downtown singing the Blues.</p>

          <p>She'll turn cold as a freezer. At the eh-end of it all. Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes. Bikinis, zucchinis, Martinis, no weenies. I hope you got a healthy appetite. We can dance, until we die, you and I, will be young forever. We're living the life. We're doing it right. Word on the street, you got somethin' to show me, me.</p>
          <p class="mb-0">Wanna see the show in 3D, a movie. They say, be afraid you're not like the others, futuristic lover. Open up your heart. So I sat quietly, agreed politely. Last Friday night. Yeah, you're lucky if you're on her plane. I'll be your gift, give you something good to celebrate.</p>

          <p>Come on, let your colours burst. I can feel this light that's inside of me. All night they're playing, your song. From Tokyo to Mexico, to Rio. There’s no going back. But down to earth. Magical, colorful, Mr. Mystery, ee. Different DNA, they don't understand you.</p>
          <p class="mb-0">But down to earth. She's got that, je ne sais quoi, you know it. I can see the writing on the wall. The boys break their necks try'na to creep a little sneak peek. Take me, ta-ta-take me. Open up your heart. Thought that I was the exception. Boom, boom, boom. Venice beach and Palm Springs, summertime is everything. Bring the beat back. (This is how we do)</p>

          <p>I know there will be sacrifice but that's the price. Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock? Be your teenage dream tonight. Uh-huh, I see you. There’s no going back. Yeah, we maxed our credit cards and got kicked out of the bar. So let me get you in your birthday suit. You may fall in love when you meet her. Had the world in the palm of your hands. Don't let the greatness get you down, oh, oh yeah. Now we talking astrology, getting our nails did, all Japanese-y. Make me your Aphrodite.</p>

            <p>All my girls vintage Chanel baby. So you can have your cake. Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air. Slowly swallowing down my fear, yeah yeah. Growing fast into a bolt of lightning. So hot and heavy, 'Til dawn. That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor. Heavy is the head that wears the crown.</p>

            <p>Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed. Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine. Be your teenage dream tonight. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. It's not even a holiday, nothing to celebrate. A perfect storm, perfect storm.</p>
